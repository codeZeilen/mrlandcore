#' @title calcYieldsLPJmL

#' @description This function extracts yields from LPJmL in the first season (main growing period)
#'              and calculates the yields for the off season (second growing period)
#'
#' @param lpjml         Defines LPJmL version for main crop inputs
#' @param climatetype   Switch between different climate scenarios
#' @param selectyears   Option to reduce number of years to be returned
#'                      (e.g., to avoid memory issues)
#' @param multicropping Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and
#'                      Multiple Cropping Suitability mask selected
#'                      (mask can be:
#'                      "none": no mask applied (only for development purposes)
#'                      "actual:total": currently multicropped areas calculated from total harvested areas
#'                                      and total physical areas per cell from readLandInG
#'                      "actual:crop" (crop-specific), "actual:irrigation" (irrigation-specific),
#'                      "actual:irrig_crop" (crop- and irrigation-specific),
